Graphs

- Graphs are used to represent networks of interconnected elements. A graph consists of vertices (nodes) and edges (connections between nodes).

Basic Operations

1. Traversal: Visiting all the vertices and edges in the graph (BFS, DFS).

2. Shortest Path: Finding the shortest path between two nodes (Dijkstra's Algorithm, Bellman-Ford Algorithm).

3. Cycle Detection: Detecting if there is a cycle in the graph.

4. Topological Sort: Ordering vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
