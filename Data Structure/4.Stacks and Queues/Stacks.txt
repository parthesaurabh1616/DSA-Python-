Stacks

- A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. The most recently added element is the first to be removed.

Basic Operations

1. Push: Add an element to the top of the stack.

2. Pop: Remove the top element from the stack.

3. Peek/Top: Retrieve the top element without removing it.

4. isEmpty: Check if the stack is empty.
