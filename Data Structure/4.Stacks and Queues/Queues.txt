Queues

- A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. The first element added is the first to be removed.

Basic Operations

1. Enqueue: Add an element to the end of the queue.

2. Dequeue: Remove the front element from the queue.

3. Front/Peek: Retrieve the front element without removing it.

4. isEmpty: Check if the queue is empty.
