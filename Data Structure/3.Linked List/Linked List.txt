What is a Linked List?

- A linked list is a linear data structure where each element (node) contains a data part and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not have a fixed size and can grow or shrink dynamically.

Basic Operations

1. Traversal: Visiting each node in the linked list.

2. Insertion: Adding a new node at a specific position.

3. Deletion: Removing a node from a specific position.

4. Searching: Finding a node with a specific value.
