Hashing:

- Hashing is a technique used to map data to a fixed-size array,
making searching, insertion, and deletion operations efficient. 

- Hashing often uses a hash function to convert keys into array indices.

- Fast Lookups 🔥: O(1) average-case time complexity for insertion, deletion, and search.

- Efficient Data Storage 🗄️: Quickly find data without scanning every element.

- Used in Real-World Applications:
   - Databases (indexing)
   - Caches
   - Cryptography (SHA, MD5)
   - Unique identifier generation
