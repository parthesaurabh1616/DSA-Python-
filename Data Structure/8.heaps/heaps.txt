Heaps

- Heaps are specialized tree-based data structures that satisfy the heap property.

- In a max-heap, the parent node is always greater than or equal to its children.

- In a min-heap, the parent node is always less than or equal to its children. 

- Heaps are commonly used to implement priority queues.

âœ… Key Operations

1. Insertion (Push) âž•

   - Add a new element while maintaining the heap property.
   - Time Complexity: O(log n)

2. Deletion (Pop) âž–

   - Remove the root (max for max-heap, min for min-heap).
   - Time Complexity: O(log n)

3. Peek (Get Top Element) ðŸ‘€

   - Get the maximum or minimum element without removing it.
   - Time Complexity: O(1)

4. Heapify ðŸ”„

   - Convert an array into a valid heap.
   - Time Complexity: O(n)
