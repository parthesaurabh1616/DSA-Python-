What is a String?

- A string is a sequence of characters, typically used to represent text. Strings are immutable in many programming languages, meaning their contents cannot be changed once they are created.

Basic Operations

1. Traversal: Iterating through each character in the string.

2. Concatenation: Joining two or more strings.

3. Substring: Extracting a portion of a string.

4. Searching: Finding the occurrence of a substring within a string.
